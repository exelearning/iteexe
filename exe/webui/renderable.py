"""
This unit provides a base class for something that is rendered, this can be
a page, a pane, a block, even part of JSUI like the outlinePane but not really
going down to the element level. We'll call them rendering components.

It provides a way to get at your parent rendering component, the top being the
mainpage, who has no parent. It also provides you with a config instance and
a package instance.  Finally it makes you a LivePage and a Resource descendant,
but you don't have to use that functionality. It means you can use a rendering
template to do your rendering, even if you're part of a bigger block.
