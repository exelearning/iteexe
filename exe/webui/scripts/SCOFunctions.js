/*******************************************************************************
** The purpose of this function is to handle cases where the current SCO may be 
** unloaded via some user action other than using the navigation controls 
** embedded in the content.   This function will be called every time an SCO
** is unloaded.  If the user has caused the page to be unloaded through the
** preferred SCO control mechanisms, the value of the "exitPageStatus" var
** will be true so we'll just allow the page to be unloaded.   If the value
** of "exitPageStatus" is false, we know the user caused to the page to be
** unloaded through use of some other mechanism... most likely the back
** button on the browser.  We'll handle this situation the same way we 
** would handle a "quit" - as in the user pressing the SCO's quit button.

** eXe team: we've added this doLMSSetValue here to get tracking working with Moodle
** cmi.core.lesson_status is now set to 'completed' whenever a sco is unloaded.
