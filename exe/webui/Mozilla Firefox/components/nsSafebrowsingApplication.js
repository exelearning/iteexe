// This file implements an event registrar, an object with which you
// can register handlers for arbitrary programmer-defined
// events. Events are arbitrary strings and listeners are functions
// taking an object (stuffed with arguments) as a parameter. When you
// fire an event through the registrar, all listeners are invoked in
// an unspecified order. The firing function takes an object to be
// passed into each handler (it is _not_ copied, so be careful). We
// chose this calling convention so we don't have to change handler
// signatures when adding new information.
//
// Why not just use notifier/observers? Because passing data around
// with them requires either serialization or a new xpcom interface,
// both of which are a pain in the ass.
//
// Example:
//
// // Set up a listener
// this.handleTabload = function(e) {
//   foo(e.url);
//   bar(e.browser);
// };
//
// // Set up the registrar
// var eventTypes = ["tabload", "tabunload", "tabswitch"];
// var registrar = new EventRegistrar(eventTypes);
// var handler = BindToObject(this.handleTabload, this);
//
// // Register a listener
// registrar.registerListener("tabload", handler);
//
// // Fire an event and remove the listener
// var event = { "url": "http://www", "browser": browser };
// registrar.fire("tabload", event);
// registrar.removeListener("tabload", handler);

// This file implements a G_TabbedBrowserWatcher, an object
// encapsulating and abstracting the mechanics of working with tabs
// and the documents within them. The watcher provides notification of
// various DOM-related events (a document loaded, a document unloaded,
// tab was created/destroyed, user switched tabs, etc.) as well as
// commonly required methods (get me the current tab, find the tab to
// which this document belongs, etc.).
//
// This class does not do progresslistener-based notifications; for that,
// use the NavWatcher.
//
// Note: I use "browser" and "tab" interchangeably.
//
// This class adds a level of indirection to event registration. You
// initialize it with a tabbedbrowser, and then register to hear
// events from it instead of from the tabbedbrowser or browser itself.
// Your handlers are invoked with a custom object as an argument (see
// below). This object contains useful information such as a reference
// to the browser in which the event is happening and whether the
// event is occurring on the top-level document in that browser.
//
// The events you can register to hear are:
//
// EVENT             DESCRIPTION
// -----             -----------
// load              Fires when a page is shown in the browser window and
//                   this page wasn't in the bfcache
//
// unload            Fires when a page is nav'd away from in the browser window
//                   and the page isn't going into the bfcache
//
// pageshow          Fires when a page is shown in the browser window, whether
//                   it came from bfcache or not. (There is a "persisted"
//                   property we can get from the event object if we'd like.
//                   It indicates whether the page was loaded from bfcache.
//                   If false then we known load recently fired).
//
// pagehide          Fires when a page is nav'd away from in the browser,
//                   whether its going into the bfcache or not. (There is
//                   a persisted property here as well that we're not
//                   propagating -- when its true the page is going into
//                   the bfcache, else it's not, and unload will shortly
//                   fire).
//
// domcontentloaded  BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN
//                   Fires when a doc's DOM is ready, but its externally linked
//                   content hasn't necessarily loaded. This event is
//                   currently broken: it doesn't fire when using the
//                   forward/back buttons in conjunction with the bfcache.
//                   Bryner is working on a fix.
//
// tabload           Fires when a new tab has been created (but doesn't
//                   necessarily have content loaded in it)
//
// tabunload         Fires when a tab is being destroyed (and might have had
//                   the content it contains destroyed)
//
// tabswitch         Fires when the user switches tabs
//
// tabmove           Fires when a user drags a tab to a different position
//
//
// For pageshow, pagehide, load, unload, and domcontentloaded, the event
// object you'll receive has the following properties:
//
//      doc -- reference to Document on which the event fired
//      browser -- the browser in which the document resides
//      isTop -- boolean indicating if it is the top-level document
//      inSelected -- boolean indicating if it is in the currently selected tab
//
// For tabload and unload it has:
//
//      browser -- reference to the browser that is loading or closing
//
// For tabswitch it has:
//
//      fromBrowser -- reference to the browser user is switching from
//      toBrowser -- reference to the browser user is switching to
//
// For tabmove it has:
//
//      tab -- the tab that was moved (Note that this is the actual
//             tab widget that holds the document title, not the
//             browser object.  We use this because it's the target
//             of the DOMNodeInserted event.)
//      fromIndex -- the tab index before the move
//      toIndex -- the tab index after the move
//
//
// The order of events is:                   tabload
//                                           domcontentloaded
//                                           load
//                                           pageshow
//                                           --  --
//                                           pagehide
//                                           unload
//                                           tabunload
//
// Example:
//
// function handler(e /*event object*/) {
//   foo(e.browser);
// };
// var watcher = new G_TabbedBrowserWatcher(document.getElementById(gBrowser));
// watcher.registerListener("load", handler);      // register for events
// watcher.removeListener("load", handler);        // unregister
//
//
// TODO, BUGS, ISSUES, COMPLICATIONS:
//
// The only major problem is in closing tabs:
//
//     + When you close a tab, the reference to the Document you get in the
//       unload event is undefined. We pass this along. This could easily
//       be fixed by not listening for unload at all, but instead inferring
//       it from the information in pagehide, and then firing our own "fake"
//       unload after firing pagehide.
//
//     + There's no docshell during the pagehide event, so we can't determine
//       if the document is top-level. We pass undefined in this case.
//
//     + Though the browser reference during tabunload will be valid, its
//       members most likely have already been torn down. Use it in an
//       objectsafemap to keep state if you need its members.
//
//     + The event listener DOMNodeInserted has the potential to cause
//       performance problems if there are too many events fired.  It
//       should be ok, since we inserted it as far as possible into
//       the xul tree.
//
//
// TODO: need better enforcement of unique names. Two tabbedbrowserwatchers
//       with the same name will clobber each other because they use that
//       name to mark browsers they've seen.
// 
// TODO: the functions that iterate of windows and documents badly need
//       to be made cleaner. Right now we have multiple implementations
//       that essentially do the same thing :(
//
// But good enough for government work.

// There is one BrowserView per browser window, and each BrowserView
// is responsible for keeping track of problems (phishy documents)
// within that window. The BrowserView is also responsible for
// figuring out what to do about such problems, for example, whether
// the tab with a phishy page is currently showing and therefore if we
// should be showing a warning.
// 
// The BrowserView receives information from three places:
//
// - from the phishing warden. When the phishing warden notices a
//   problem, it queries all browser views to see which one (if any)
//   has the Document that is problematic. It then hands the problem
//   off to the appropriate BrowserView.
// 
// - from the controller. The controller responds to explicit user 
//   actions (tab switches, requests to hide the warning message, 
//   etc.) and let's the BrowserView know about any user action 
//   having to do with the problems it is tracking.
//
// - from the TabbedBrowserWatcher. When the BrowserView is keeping
//   track of a problematic document it listens for interesting
//   events affecting it, for example pagehide (at which point
//   we presumably hide the warning if we're showing it).
//
// The BrowserView associates at most one "problem" with each Document
// in the browser window. It keeps state about which Documents are 
// problematic by storing a "problem queue" on each browser (tab).
// At most one problematic document per browser (tab) is active
// at any time. That is, we show the warning for at most one phishy
// document at any one time. If another phishy doc loads in that tab,
// it goes onto the end of the queue to be activated only when the
// currently active document goes away.
//
// If we had multiple types of warnings (one for after the page had
// loaded, one for when the user clicked a link, etc) here's where
// we'd select the appropate one to use. As it stands, we only have
// one displayer (an "afterload" displayer). A displayer knows _how_
// to display a warning, whereas as the BrowserView knows _what_ and
// _when_.
//
// To keep things (relatively) easy to reason about and efficient (the
// phishwarden could be querying us inside a progresslistener
// notification, or the controller inside an event handler), we have
// the following rules:
//
// - at most one of a displayer's start() or stop() methods is called
//   in any iteration (if calling two is required, the second is run in 
//   the next event loop)
// - displayers should run their operations synchronously so we don't have
//   to look two places (here and in the displayer) to see what is happening 
//   when
// - displayer actions are run after cleaning up the browser view state
//   in case they have consequences
//
// TODO: this could use some redesign, but I don't have time.
// TODO: the queue needs to be abstracted, but we want another release fast,
//       so I'm not going to touch it for the time being
// TODO: IDN issues and canonical URLs?
// TODO: Perhaps we should blur the page before showing a warning in order
//       to prevent stray keystrokes?

// This is our controller -- the thingy that listens to what the user

// declineAction() -- fired when the user declines the warning.
// acceptAction() -- fired when the user declines the warning
// explicitShow() -- fired when the user wants to see the warning again
// browserSelected() -- the browser is the top tab
// browserUnselected() -- the browser is no long the top tab
// done() -- clean up. May be called once (even if the displayer wasn't
//           activated).

// The warden checks request to see if they are for phishy pages. It
// does so by either querying a remote server with the URL (advanced
// protectoin mode) or querying our locally stored blacklists (privacy
// mode).
// 
// When the warden notices a problem, it queries all browser views
// (each of which corresopnds to an open browser window) to see
// whether one of them can handle it. A browser view can handle a
// problem if its browser window has an HTMLDocument loaded with the
// given URL and that Document hasn't already been flagged as a
// problem. For every problematic URL we notice loading, at most one
// Document is flagged as problematic. Otherwise you can get into
// trouble if multiple concurrent phishy pages load with the same URL.
//
// Since we check URLs very early in the request cycle (in a progress
// listener), the URL might not yet be associated with a Document when
// we determine that it is phishy. So the the warden retries finding
// a browser view to handle the problem until one can, or until it
// determines it should give up (see complicated logic below).
//
// The warden has displayers that the browser view uses to render
// different kinds of warnings (e.g., one that's shown before a page
// loads as opposed to one that's shown after the page has already
// loaded).

  // to retry forever (e.g., what if the Document was already displayed
  // and navigated away from?), so we'll use nsIRequest.isPending to help
  // us decide what to do.
  //
  // Acomplication arises because there is a lag between when a
  // request transitions from pending to not-pending and when it's
  // associated with a Document in a browser. The transition from
  // pending to not occurs just before the notification corresponding
  // to NavWatcher.DOCNAVSTART (see NavWatcher), but the association
  // occurs afterwards. Unfortunately, we're probably in DOCNAVSTART.
  // 
  // Diagnosis by Darin:
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Here's a summary of what happens:
  //
  //   RestorePresentation() {
  //     Dispatch_OnStateChange(dummy_request, STATE_START)
  //     PostCompletionEvent()
  //   }
  //
  //   CompletionEvent() {
  //     ReallyRestorePresentation()
  //     Dispatch_OnStateChange(dummy_request, STATE_STOP)
  //   }
  //
  // So, now your code receives that initial OnStateChange event and sees
  // that the dummy_request is not pending and not loaded in any window.
  // So, you put a timeout(0) event in the queue.  Then, the CompletionEvent
  // is added to the queue.  The stack unwinds....
  //
  // Your timeout runs, and you find that the dummy_request is still not
  // pending and not loaded in any window.  Then the CompletionEvent
  // runs, and it hooks up the cached presentation.
  // 
  // https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319527
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // So the logic is:
  //
  //         request     found an unhandled          
  //  case   pending?    doc with the url?         action
  //  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  //   1      yes             yes           Use that doc (handled above)
  //   2      no              yes           Use that doc (handled above)
  //   3      yes             no            Retry
  //   4      no              no            Retry twice (case described above)
  //
  // We don't get into trouble with Docs with the same URL "stealing" the 
  // warning because there is exactly one warning signaled per nav to 
  // a problem URL, and each Doc can be marked as problematic at most once.
